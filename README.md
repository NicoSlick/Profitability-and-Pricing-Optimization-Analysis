# Profitability and Pricing Optimization Analysis
 SQL-based analysis to identify inefficiencies in supply chain profitability, focusing on product-level performance, discount impact, and sales contributions.

This project uses SQL to analyze and optimize supply chain performance by focusing on product profitability, pricing strategies, and discount impact. Using a public supply chain dataset that includes financial figures, the analysis identifies key areas of improvementâ€”such as low-margin products and the impact of discounts on profitability. The goal is to provide actionable insights that help streamline pricing models, reduce pricing inefficiencies, and improve overall profitability in supply chain operations.
